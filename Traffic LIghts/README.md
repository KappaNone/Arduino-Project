# Arduino Traffic Light

This project simulates a traffic light using an Arduino board and three LEDs for red, yellow, and green signals.

## Components Required

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- Resistors (to limit current flow through LEDs)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Circuit Connection

Connect the components as follows:

- Red LED: Connect to pin 8 on the Arduino board
- Yellow LED: Connect to pin 9 on the Arduino board
- Green LED: Connect to pin 10 on the Arduino board

Make sure to use appropriate resistors to limit the current flow through the LEDs to prevent damage to the Arduino board.
