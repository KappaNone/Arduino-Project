# Arduino BMP180 Sensor Project

This project demonstrates how to interface a BMP180 barometric pressure and temperature sensor with an Arduino UNO board to measure temperature and pressure.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino UNO board
- BMP180 sensor
- Jumper wires

## Installation

1. Connect the BMP180 sensor to the Arduino UNO board following the hardware setup instructions.
2. Install the required libraries in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the board.

## Hardware Setup

Connect the BMP180 sensor to the Arduino UNO board as follows:

- VCC -> 3.3V or 5V
- GND -> GND
- SDA -> A4
- SCL -> A5

## Software Setup

1. Install the Adafruit BMP085/BMP180 library in the Arduino IDE.
2. Use the provided Arduino sketch for reading temperature and pressure from the BMP180 sensor.

## Usage

- Upload the provided sketch to your Arduino UNO board.
- Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view temperature and pressure readings.
