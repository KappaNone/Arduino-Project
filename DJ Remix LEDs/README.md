# Arduino DJ Remix LED Project

## Description

This project creates a dynamic DJ remix light show using four LEDs (red, green, blue, and yellow) connected to an Arduino. The LEDs light up in various patterns to mimic the effects you might see in a DJ setup.

## Components

- 1 x Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- 1 x Red LED
- 1 x Green LED
- 1 x Blue LED
- 1 x Yellow LED
- 4 x 220-ohm resistors
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Circuit Diagram

1. Connect the anode (long leg) of the red LED to digital pin 2 through a 220-ohm resistor.
2. Connect the anode of the green LED to digital pin 3 through a 220-ohm resistor.
3. Connect the anode of the blue LED to digital pin 4 through a 220-ohm resistor.
4. Connect the anode of the yellow LED to digital pin 5 through a 220-ohm resistor.
5. Connect all the cathodes (short legs) of the LEDs to the ground (GND) on the Arduino.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/arduino-dj-remix-led.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in Arduino IDE:**
   - Launch the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the `arduino-dj-remix-led.ino` file from the cloned repository.

3. **Upload the code to the Arduino:**
   - Connect your Arduino to your computer via USB.
   - Select the correct board and port from the Arduino IDE.
   - Click the "Upload" button to upload the code to your Arduino.

## Usage

Once the code is uploaded, the LEDs should start lighting up in the predefined remix pattern. You can adjust the speed of the pattern by modifying the delay value in the code.

## Notes

- Ensure that the resistors are correctly connected to avoid damaging the LEDs.
- Feel free to customize the LED patterns and delays to create your own unique light show.

## Acknowledgements

- This code was designed by Prince Kushwaha from COSM Electronics.
