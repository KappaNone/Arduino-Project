# I2C LCD Screen Project

This project aims to provide a simple guide for programming I2C LCD screens using the LiquidCrystal_I2C library with Arduino. It's designed for individuals who are looking for straightforward instructions on setting up and coding these displays.

# Requirements
- Arduino board
- I2C LCD screen
- LiquidCrystal_I2C library
- Wire library

# Setup
1. **Library Installation**: Download the LiquidCrystal_I2C and Wire libraries.
- Search for the LiquidCrystal_I2C and Wire.h in Arduino IDE libraries sections.

2. **Hardware Connections**:
   Connect the I2C LCD screen to the Arduino board as follows:
   - GND -> Ground
   - VCC -> +5V
   - SDA -> A4
   - SCL -> A5
