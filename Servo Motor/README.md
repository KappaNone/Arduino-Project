# Servo Motor Control

## Description
This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using an Arduino board. The servo motor rotates to specific angles in a sequence defined in the code.

## Circuit Diagram
- Attached in the Servo Motor folder.

## Components
- Arduino Board
- Servo Motor
- Jumper Wires

## Connections
- Connect the signal pin of the servo motor to pin 9 of the Arduino board.
- Connect the power (Vcc) and ground (GND) pins of the servo motor to the appropriate power and ground pins on the Arduino board.

## Usage
1. Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board.
2. Ensure the servo motor is connected according to the specified connections.
3. Power on the Arduino board.
4. The servo motor will rotate to 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees in sequence, with a delay of 1 second between each rotation.
