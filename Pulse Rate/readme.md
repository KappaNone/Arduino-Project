# Heart Rate Monitor
This project, designed by Prince Kushwaha, is a simple yet effective heart rate monitor built using an Arduino board, a Pulse Sensor, an I2C module, and an LCD display. It provides real-time monitoring of heart rate, making it useful for personal health tracking, fitness monitoring, biofeedback systems, and medical research.

## Overview
The heart rate monitor measures the heart rate by detecting pulse waves from the Pulse Sensor. The Arduino board processes the signals and displays the heart rate on the LCD display. An LED indicator blinks with each detected heartbeat.

## Components
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Pulse Sensor
- LCD display (16x2 characters)
- Breadboard
- I2C module
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
- The circuit diagram illustrates the connections between the components. Detailed instructions on wiring can be found in the repository.

## How It Works
1. The Pulse Sensor is attached to a finger, detecting blood flow and generating analog signals.
2. The analog signals are processed by the Arduino board, which calculates the heart rate.
3. The heart rate data is displayed on the LCD screen in beats per minute (BPM).
4. An LED indicator flashes with each detected heartbeat, providing visual feedback.

## Usage
This heart rate monitor can be used in various applications:
- Personal health monitoring: Track your heart rate during exercise or rest.
- Fitness trackers: Integrate heart rate monitoring into fitness devices.
- Biofeedback systems: Provide real-time feedback for stress management or relaxation techniques.
- Medical research: Gather heart rate data for medical studies and experiments.
